# Overview

Use this Pipeline Pattern to create Box folders for Salesforce cases. For an account created in Salesforce, SnapLogic checks if a Box folder named with the Salesforce case number exists.&#x20;

If the folder doesnâ€™t exist, SnapLogic creates a new Box folder and names it with the Salesforce case number. SnapLogic also creates a shared link to the newly created Box folder.
