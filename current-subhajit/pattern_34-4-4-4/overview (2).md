# Overview

Use this Pipeline Pattern to create an API that accepts the email ID of a user as input and returns the list of project folders in SnapLogic to which the user has Read, Write and Execute (RWX) permissions. If the user doesnâ€™t have full access to any of the folders, the Pipeline returns an empty array list.

This Pattern helps to maintain governance by verifying the access level information for each user.
