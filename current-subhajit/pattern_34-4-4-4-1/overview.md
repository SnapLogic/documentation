# Overview

Use this Pipeline Pattern to incrementally fetch records from a document-oriented NoSQL database system (MongoDB) and load them to the cloud storage in AWS S3 with partitioning logic. This use case is applicable to Cloud Data Lake initiatives.

This Pipeline also includes the date-based data partitioning at the Storage layer and the data validation trail between the source and target endpoint.&#x20;
