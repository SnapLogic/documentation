# Overview

Use this Pipeline Pattern to search issues submitted within the last day (at the time the Pipeline is run) and within the specified projects in JIRA, and send out the information in an email message. It also uses the routing trick described in [Performing an Action when there is no data ](https://community.snaplogic.com/t/performing-an-action-when-there-is-no-data/380)to send an alternate email when no data is received.
