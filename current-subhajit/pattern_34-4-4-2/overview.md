# Overview

Use the parent Pipeline Pattern to generate the Apache Avro schema by querying the metadata for an Oracle table. The Pipeline also generates the `create table` statement for the Apache Hive.

Use the child  Pipeline Pattern to write the schema file and DDL file to the Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and the SnapLogic Database (SLDB).
