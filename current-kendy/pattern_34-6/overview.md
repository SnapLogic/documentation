# Overview

Use this Pipeline Pattern to look for NetSuite cases in the past 24 hours and bring them to ServiceNow. The Pipeline attempts to bring the email of the NetSuite user but if none is found it defaults to ServiceNow. You could use the NetSuite Contact to ServiceNow User Pattern in conjunction with this one to ensure that a ServiceNow user exists for each NetSuite contact.
