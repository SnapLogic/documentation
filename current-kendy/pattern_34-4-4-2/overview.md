# Overview

Use this Pipeline Pattern to return the current, previous, and next fiscal period data using a Pipeline parameter for the input date as search criteria. The Pipeline uses an input file to store the list of fiscal periods but could easily be extended to use a database table or other input sources. It can also be configured to use an input document instead of Pipeline parameter if called from a parent Pipeline using the Pipeline Execute Snap.
