# Overview

Use this Pipeline Pattern to generate a Google Sheet containing key information relating to all Pipelines within a customer's organization. This allows customers to maintain both a consolidated and up-to-date view of all Pipelines within a specific organization alongside its last run status and other important metadata.&#x20;

This Pipeline would need to be scheduled to run on a set cadence. The Pattern could be further adapted to write the output to an alternative destination or even consumed externally as an API.
