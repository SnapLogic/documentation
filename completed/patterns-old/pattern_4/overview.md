# Overview

Use this Pipeline pattern to update a Salesforce account in a Box folder. For an account created in Salesforce, this Pipeline checks if a Box folder named with the Salesforce case number exists. If the account does not exist, the Pipeline creates a new Box folder and names it with the Salesforce case number. The Pipeline also creates a shared link to the newly created Box folder.
