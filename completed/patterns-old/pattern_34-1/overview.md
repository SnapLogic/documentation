# Overview

Use this Pipeline Pattern to look for all Salesforce Cases and bring them into ServiceNow. If the Pipeline finds no email associated with a Salesforce user, it will use a default ServiceNow email. You may want to use the Salesforce Contact to ServiceNow User Pattern in conjunction with this Pattern to ensure that a ServiceNow user exists for each corresponding Salesforce contact.
