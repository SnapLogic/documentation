# Using this Pattern

**Steps**

1. Click **Use Pattern** and select the Project space you want to save the Pipeline in.
2. In **Designer**, click the Pipelines icon on the left panel and browse to the location where you saved the pattern.
3. Click the pattern to launch it as a Pipeline.
4. Configure your account in SnapLogic using the account information in the original application.
5. Open each Snap and configure the **Settings** per your requirements.
6. Save the Snap/Pipeline, validate, and run it.

If the Pipeline runs successfully, you can view the output. For more information, read this article: [My First Pipeline](https://docs-snaplogic.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SD/pages/1438412).

**How to Configure the Pipeline**

The first Mapper maps the JIRA issue ID and the issue comments to the ServiceNow incident. Other fields are manually set in the Mapper. You can either update the values or map the fields that need to be carried over.
