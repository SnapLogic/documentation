# Overview

Use this Pipeline Pattern to get product details from Oracle, SAP, and Salsify based on the Universal Product Code (UPC).

A lookup is done in Oracle for product details and SAP for additional product details and the materials that compose the product. That information is then passed into Salsify which retrieves sales data regarding the product, and the aggregated information can then be displayed in applications like Salesforce.&#x20;
