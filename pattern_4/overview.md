# Overview

Updates a Salesforce account in a Box folder. For an account created in Salesforce, SnapLogic checks if a Box folder named with the Salesforce case number exists. If the account doesnâ€™t exist, SnapLogic creates a new Box folder and names it with the Salesforce case number. SnapLogic also creates a shared link to the newly created Box folder.
