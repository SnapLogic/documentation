-   -   **Note:** When configuring a SAP account that is used to connect to SAP DWC, enter the Database name in this format: `Database name: Space Schema Name`. For the account to work as expected, you must [add SnapLogic IP addresses to the allow list](https://docs-snaplogic.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SD/pages/1449033775) in your SAP DWC. This entry must be approved by SAP before you can connect to the SAP DWC. For more information about adding IP addresses to the Allow list, refe to the [SAP Documentation](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9f804b8efa8043539289f42f372c4862/cloud/en-US/a3c214514ef94e899459f68f4c1e2a23.html).
