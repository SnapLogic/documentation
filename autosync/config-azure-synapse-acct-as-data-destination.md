# Configure an Azure Synapse Analytics connection

Create a new connection configuration for Azure Synapse Analytics by entering the following:

-   A unique, meaningful name such as `Sales-Shared-Synapse`. If a configuration with the same name exists, AutoSync displays an `Asset conflict error message`.
-   **Account Properties**
    -   WORK IN PROGRESS
-   **Validate and Save**: After saving and validating, AutoSync adds the configuration to the list of saved connections.

-   **Select schema**: AutoSync populates this list from the account. Choose the schema to use as the destination.
