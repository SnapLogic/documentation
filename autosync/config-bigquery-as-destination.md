# Configure a Google BigQuery connection

To configure BigQuery as a new connection:

-   Provide a unique, meaningful name such as `Sales-Shared-BigQuery.` If a configuration with the same name exists, AutoSync displays an `Asset conflict error message`.
-   Authorize AutoSync with your Google account.

After authorization:

-   Enter the ID of the BigQuery Project to load data into.
-   From the **Schema** list, select the destination schema.
