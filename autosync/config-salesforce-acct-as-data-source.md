# Configure a Salesforce account as a source

When creating or editing an AutoSync integration, step 1 requires you to provide connection parameters for the selected source. You can create a new connection configuration or select from saved configurations. When available, the list of saved configurations includes:

-   The global **shared** folder
-   The **shared** folder, in the **~SL-AutoSyncProjectSpace**
-   Your AutoSync project, **~User~<username\>\_<snaplogic\_org\>**, in the **~SL-AutoSync-ProjectSpace**
