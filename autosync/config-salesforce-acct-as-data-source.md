# Configure a Salesforce account as a source

When creating or editing an AutoSync integration, step 1 requires you to provide connection parameters for the selected source. You can create a new connection configuration or select from saved configurations. When available, the list of saved configurations includes:

-   Connection configurations that you created in AutoSync.
-   Accounts that you or an Org admin created in the IIP that are saved in:
    -   The global **shared** folder
    -   The **shared** folder, in the **\\~SL-AutoSyncProjectSpace**
    -   Your AutoSync project, **\\~User~<username\>\_<snaplogic\_org\>**, in the **\\~SL-AutoSync-ProjectSpace**
