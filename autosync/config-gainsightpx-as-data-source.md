# Configure a connection to Gainsight PX

Create a new connection configuration for Gainsight PX by entering the following:

-   A unique, meaningful name such as `Gainsight-Marketing`. If a configuration with the same name exists, AutoSync displays an `Asset conflict error message`.
-   The API Key that is generated while configuring your Gainsight account. You need to generate a new API key for each integration in the Gainsight interface. Refer to the [Gainsight documentation](https://support.gainsight.com/SFDC_Edition/Connectors/Connectors/API_Integrations/Generate_API_Access_Key) for more information.
-   **Save**: After Saving, AutoSync adds the connection configuration to the dropdown list of the existing connections.
