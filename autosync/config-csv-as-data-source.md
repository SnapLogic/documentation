# Uploading CSV files as a source

To use CSV files as a source for an AutoSync integration:

-   The files must have a header and use comma delimiters.
-   The total size of the selected files must be 100 MB or less.

After you select the files to upload, AutoSync loads them into SnapLogic file storage. After you save the integration, AutoSync loads the data to the destination and deletes the files from SnapLogic storage. You can reuse the integration later by selecting different files.
