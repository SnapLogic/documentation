# Configure a Marketo connection

Create a new connection configuration for Marketo:

-   Enter a unique, meaningful name such as `Marketing-admin-Marketo`. If a configuration with the same name exists, AutoSync displays an `Asset conflict error message`.
-   WIP
-   **Validate and Save**: After saving and validating, AutoSync adds the configuration to the list of saved connections.

-   **Select Spreadsheet**: The spreadsheet to use as a source for this integration. For example, `NEW LEADS DATA`. After selecting a destination, you will choose which tables to load.
