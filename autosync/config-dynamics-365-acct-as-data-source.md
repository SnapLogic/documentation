# Configure a Microsoft Dynamics 365 connection

Create a new connection configuration for Dynamics 365 by entering the following:

-   A unique, meaningful name such as `Dynamics-365-Sales`. If a configuration with the same name exists, AutoSync displays an `Asset conflict error message`.
-   **Account Properties**:
    -   WORK IN PROGRES
-   **Validate and Save**: After saving and validating, AutoSync adds the configuration to the list of saved connections.

-   **Select schema**: AutoSync populates this list from the account. Choose the schema that contains the tables to load as a source.


After you select a destination, you will choose the tables to load and synchronize.
