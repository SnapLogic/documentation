# Configure a connection to Zendesk

Create a new connection configuration for Zendesk by entering the following:

-   A unique, meaningful name such as `Zendesk-Shared`. If a configuration with the same name exists, AutoSync displays an `Asset conflict error message`.
-   **Token**: Zendesk administrators generate and provide the API Token from the Zendesk Admin center. A token must be in the following format: \(email\)/token:\(api\_token\). Refer to the Zendesk documentation for more information.
-   **Save**: After saving, AutoSync adds the connection configuration to the dropdown list of existing connections.
-   **Domain**: The domain is the URL used to connect to Zendesk. For example, *https://subdomain.zendesk.com*.
