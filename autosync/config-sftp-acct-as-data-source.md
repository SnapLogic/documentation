# Configure an SFTP connection

Create a new connection configuration for SFTP by entering the following:

-   A unique, meaningful name such as `SFTP-Marketing-Storage`. If a configuration with the same name exists, AutoSync displays an `Asset conflict error message`.
-   **Account Properties**:
    -   **Username**: A username for an account with the correct permissions for AutoSync to load and synchronize data.
    -   **Password**: The password for the account. Note that multiple retries with an invalid password can cause your account to be locked.

After configuring a destination, you will choose which files to synchronize.
