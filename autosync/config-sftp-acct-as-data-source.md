# Configure an SFTP connection

Create a new connection configuration for SFTP by entering the following:

-   A unique, meaningful name such as `SFTP-Marketing-Storage`. If a configuration with the same name exists, AutoSync displays an `Asset conflict error message`.
-   **Account Properties**:
    -   WIP
    -       -   
After configuring a destination, you will choose which files to synchronize.
