# Configure a Microsoft SQL Server connection

Create a new connection configuration for SQL Server by entering the following:

-   A unique, meaningful name such as `S3-Integration`.
-   **Account Properties**:
    -   You can use either an IP \(`14.8.276.318`\), or URL \(`sqlservertest.cwstru.us-west-1.rds.amzaws.com`\) for hostname.
    -       -       -       -   
After you select a destination, you will choose the tables to load and synchronize.
