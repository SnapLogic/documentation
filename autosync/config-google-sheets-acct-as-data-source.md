# Configure a Google Sheets connection

Create a new connection configuration for Google Sheets:

-   Enter a unique, meaningful name such as `Accounting-Google-Spreadsheet`. If a configuration with the same name exists, AutoSync displays an `Asset conflict error message`.
-   **Authorize:** Authorizes **SnapLogic Sheets & Drive Integration** with your Google Account.
-   **Validate and Save**: After saving and validating, AutoSync adds the configuration to the list of saved connections.

-   **Select Spreadsheet**: The spreadsheet to use as a source for this integration. For example, `NEW LEADS DATA`. After selecting a destination, you will choose which sheets to load.
